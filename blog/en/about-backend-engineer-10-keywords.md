Here are 10 key terms related to backend engineering, covering essential skills, tools, and work methodologies:  

1. **Node.js / Python / Java / Ruby / PHP** – Common backend programming languages used to build server-side applications.  

2. **Database** – Includes **SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)** and **NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB, Redis)** for data storage, management, and optimization.  

3. **REST API / GraphQL** – Designing and implementing server-side APIs to support frontend data requests.  

4. **Authentication & Authorization** – Technologies like OAuth, JWT, and session management to ensure user security and data protection.  

5. **Docker / Kubernetes** – Containerization and orchestration tools for application deployment and resource management.  

6. **Cloud Services** – Platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure for cloud-based application hosting and operations.  

7. **Microservices** – Architectural style for designing modular and independently deployable services.  

8. **Message Queues** – Tools like RabbitMQ and Kafka for asynchronous communication in distributed systems.  

9. **Version Control** – Systems like Git/GitHub for code management and team collaboration.  

10. **Performance Optimization** – Techniques for improving server and database performance to enhance system efficiency.  

These key concepts form the foundation of a backend engineer’s work and career growth. By continuously gaining experience and developing projects, one can become a more proficient software engineer.
