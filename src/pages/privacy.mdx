# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 2025-12-16

KD Tech Blog ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome Extension and website collect, use, and store your data.

---

## 1. Single Purpose

KD Tech Blog is designed to help users save job postings and learning resources from multiple platforms with one click, and organize their job search progress and career learning in a structured, privacy-first way using local storage.

We do not collect any personal data beyond what is required for this single purpose.

---

## 2. Data We Collect

We **do not collect personally identifiable information (PII)**, financial, health, or authentication information.

The only data processed by the extension are:

- **Web pages you explicitly save**

  - Job postings from supported platforms (104, 1111, Yourator, Cake, LinkedIn, Indeed)
  - Learning resources (YouTube, online courses, books, etc.)

- **Local notes and status**
  - Application status (Saved → Applied → Interviewing → Offer / Rejected)
  - User notes (interview notes, salary negotiation notes)

> All data is stored **locally in your browser**. Nothing is sent to external servers.

## 3. Permissions

The extension uses the following permissions:

- **activeTab**: Access the currently active tab only when the user clicks the extension. Needed to extract job/resource information.
- **tabs**: Retrieve tab title and URL to correctly identify content.
- **storage**: Store bookmarks, progress, and notes locally.
- **scripting**: Inject scripts on supported pages to extract relevant metadata.
- **host_permissions**: Access supported platforms only when the user saves content.

**Important:** All permissions are **user-initiated** and limited to the scope required for the extension's single purpose.

## 4. Remote Code

This extension **does not load or execute any remote JavaScript or WebAssembly**. All code is included in the extension package.

---

## 5. Third-Party Sharing

We do **not sell or transfer user data to third parties**, except for the approved functionality of the extension.

We do **not use or transfer data for purposes unrelated to the extension's single purpose**.

We do **not use or transfer data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes**.

## 6. User Control

Users can:

- Save or delete any bookmarked job or learning resource at any time.
